# Chess Engine To-Do

# Improve Evaluation
- Mobility of pieces: count how many legal moves there are; more is better
- Piece square tables: knights are better in the center and worse on the edges
- King safety: keep king away from open files and enemy pieces
- Pawn structures: avoid doubled and isolated pawns, reward connected pawns and passed pawns
- Checkmate scoring: avoid walking into checkmate

# Improve Search
- Minimax search
