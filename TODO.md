# Chess Engine To-Do

# Improve Evaluation
- Mobility of pieces: count how many legal moves there are; more is better

- King safety: keep king away from open files and enemy pieces
- Pawn structures: avoid doubled and isolated pawns, reward connected pawns and passed pawns
- Checkmate scoring: avoid walking into checkmate


## Future Improvements
- Improved UI
- Implementation to LiChess
- Evaluate strength using SPRT
- Add an Opening Book
- Add Endgame Tables
- Investigate neural networks
